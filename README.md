# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Project Overview:
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the factors influencing customer churn. By analyzing key features such as **contract types**, **payment methods**, and **customer tenure**, the goal is to uncover patterns that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Key Insights:
- **Contract Types**: Month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate (42%) compared to yearly or two-year contracts.
- **Payment Methods**: Customers using electronic checks show the highest churn rate at 45%.
- **Customer Tenure**: Churn is highest within the first year (50%) and decreases as tenure increases.
- **Service Type**: Fiber optic customers have a higher churn rate compared to DSL users.
- **Senior Citizens**: Senior customers have a higher churn rate (41%) compared to non-senior customers (26%).

## Tools Used:
